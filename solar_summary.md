## Data from Analysis North Solar PV System

Analysis North has a 2.85 kW-DC photovoltaic solar system installed on their place
of business in Anchorage, Alaska (Alan Mitchell's house).  The system consists of
ten 285 Watt SW 285 SolarWorld panels coupled to ten Enphase S280 microinverters.
The system is a roof-mounted system, tilted at 45 degrees and oriented 8 degrees
West of South.

The graphs below summarize the performance of the system to date.  These graphs
are updated every 10 minutes; press F5 to have your browser refresh
the data.

### Recent Production

This shows the daily energy production from the system for the last ten days.  Note that
the most recent day, shown at top, could be a partial day.

Here is a graph of the power production today (or yesterday if no production has occurred
yet today):

### Cumulative Energy Production for the Year

This graph shows the cumulative energy production of the system for the current year
and for all previous years as separate lines.  For example, a value of 300 kWh on the
Y-axis for day number 80 means that a total of 300 kWh were produced for the first 80
days of the year.

This graph below is the same as above except it does not show days of the year beyond the
current day.

### Monthly Energy and Power

This graph shows the total number of kWh produced in each month;
each year is shown on a separate line so monthly comparisons between years
are possible.  Note that the most recent month is usually a partial month so will
appear to have a low value.

![monthly production](images/by_month_by_year.png?q=1)

This graph shows the peak power production that has occurred in each month.  It finds
the peak power across *all* of the years of data for each month.

![monthly peak power](images/max_power.png?q=1)

Below, an average production profile is shown for each month.  The Y-axis value is average
power in Watts produced for the hour (0 - 23) shown on the X-axis.

### Spread of Daily Production Values

This boxplot show the spread and the median daily energy production values for each
month.

![monthly box plot](images/monthly_box.png?q=1)

In the plot below, each dot is data from one day.  The Y-axis value is the kWh energy
produced during the day, and the X-axis value is the day of the year.  So, the graph also
is good at showing the distribution of daily energy production values that occur at
different times of the year.

### Record-Setting Days

Here is the day where the most kWh were produced:

![day with maximum energy](images/max_energy_day.png?q=1)

Here is the day that had the highest 5 minute power production.  This is generally
a day where the solar noon sun comes out from behind some clouds.  As well as the 
solar panels receiving the direct sun, they also receive substantial radiation from
sun rays redirected as they pass through the clouds adjacent to the sun.
